# wordfrontier

Word Frontier is a program that facilitates written language learning by selecting target language sentences that
are "just right" for the user.  In particular, out of a corpus of target language sentences, it chooses sentences
that contain a specified number of unknown words relative to a list of the user's "known words".  As the user adds
to their known words list, their word frontier advances, therefore showing them different sentences containing just
the right number of unknown words so as to be understandable but still useful for learning.

My friend Daniel Palm came up with name Word Frontier, which was an instant winner for this program.
